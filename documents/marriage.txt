nullity is granted in respect of the marriage under this Act and whether or not the
marriage is held to be void otherwise than on a petition under this Act.

Section 12, any child begotten or conceived before the decree is made, who would

legitimate child notwithstanding the decree of nullity.

conferring upon any child of a marriage which is null and void or which is annulled
by a decree of nullity under Section 12, any rights in or to the property of any
person, other than the parents, in any case, where, but for the passing of this Act,

reason of his not being the legitimate child of his parents.

34. Duty of Court in passing decrees.-(1) In any proceeding under Chapter V or
Chapter VI, whether defended or not, if the Court if satisfied that,- (a) any of the
grounds for granting relief exists; and (b) where the petition is founded on the
ground specified in Cl.(a) of sub-section (1) of Sec. 27, the petitioner has not in
any manner been accessory to or connived at or condoned the act of sexual
intercourse referred to therein or where the ground of the petition is cruelty, the
petitioner has not in any manner condoned the cruelty; and (c) when divorce is
sought on the ground of mutual consent, such consent has not been obtained by
force, fraud or undue influence; and (d) the petition is not presented or prosecuted
in collusion with the respondent; and (e) there has not been any unnecessary or
improper delay in instituting the proceedings; and (f) there is no other legal
ground why the relief should not be granted; then, and in such a case, but not
otherwise, the Court shall decree such relief accordingly. (2) Before proceeding
to grant any relief under this Act it shall be the duty of the Court in the first
instance, in every case where it is possible so to do consistently with the nature
and circumstances of the case, to make every endeavour to bring about a
reconciliation between the parties : Provided that nothing contained in this subsection shall apply to any proceeding wherein relief is sought on any of the
grounds specified in Cls.(c), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of sub-section (1) of Sec.27. (3)
For the purpose of aiding the Court in bringing about such reconciliation, the
Court may, if the parties so desire or if the Court thinks it just and proper so to
do, adjourn the proceedings for a reasonable period not exceeding fifteen days,
and refer the matter to any person named by the parties in this behalf or to any
person nominated by the Court if the parties fail to name any person, with
directions to report to the Court as to whether reconciliation can be and has been
effected and the Court shall in disposing of the proceeding have due regard to the
report. (4) In every case where a marriage is dissolved by a decree of divorce, the
Court passing the decree shall give a copy thereof free of cost to each of the
parties.

35. Relief for respondent in divorce and other proceedings.-- In any proceeding
for divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights, the respondent
may not only oppose the relief sought on the ground of petitioner's adultery,
cruelty or desertion, but also make counter-claim for any relief under this Act on
that ground, and if the petitioner's adultery, cruelty or desertion is proved, the
Court may give to the respondent any relief under this Act to which he or she
would have been entitled if he or she had presented a petition seeking such relief
on that ground.
36. Alimony pendente lite.-- Where in any proceeding under Chapter V or
Chapter VI it appears to the District Court that the wife has no independent
income sufficient for her support and the necessary expenses of the proceeding,
it may, on the application of the wife, order the husband to pay to her the expenses
of the proceeding, and weekly or monthly during the proceeding such sum as
having regard to the husband's income, it may seem to the Court to be reasonable.
37. Permanent alimony and maintenance.--(1) Any Court exercising jurisdiction
under Chapter V or Chapter VI may, at the time of passing any decree or at any
time subsequent to the decree, on application made to it for the purpose, order
that the husband shall secure to the wife for her maintenance and support, if
necessary, by a charge on the husband's property, such gross sum or such monthly
or periodical payment of money for a term not exceeding her life, as having regard
to her own property, if any, her husband's property and ability, the conduct of the
parties and other circumstances of the case it may seem to the Court to be just.
(2) If the District Court is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances of
either party at any time after it has made an order under sub-section (1), it may at
the instance of either party, vary, modify or rescind any such order in such manner
as it may seem to the Court to be just. (3) If the District Court is satisfied that the
wife in whose favour an order has been made under this section has remarried or
is not leading a chaste life, it may, at the instance of the husband vary, modify or
rescind any such order and in such manner as the Court may deem just.
38. Custody of children.-- In any proceeding under Chapter V or Chapter VI the
District Court may, from time to time, pass such interim orders and make such
provisions in the decree as it may seem to it to be just and proper with respect to
the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, consistently with their
wishes wherever possible, and may, after the decree, upon application by petition
for the purpose, make, revoke, suspend or vary, from time to time, all such orders
and provisions with respect to the custody, maintenance and education of such
children as might have been made by such decree or interim orders in case the
proceeding for obtaining such decree were still pending.
39. Appeals from decrees and orders.--(1) All decrees made by the Court in any
proceeding under Chapter V or Chapter VI shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (3), be appealable as decrees of the Court made in the exercise of its
original civil jurisdiction, and such appeal shall lie to the Court to which appeals

ordinarily lie from the decisions of the Court given in the exercise of its original
civil jurisdiction. (2) Orders made by the Court in any proceeding under this Act
under Sec.37 or Sec.38 shall subject to the provisions of Sub-section (3), be

Court in which the earlier petition was presented and both the petitions shall be
heard and disposed of together by the District Court in which the earlier petition
